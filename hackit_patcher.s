; This first patches skGetId to jump to a location in skVerifyHash.
; This location is at the start of a code cave that will be
; created by patching skVerifyHash to immediately return 0.
;
; When SA calls skGetId during its boot-up, which it does several
; times, it will trigger the jump. The code cave will contain the
; instructions starting at the "patch_code" label below. This code
; reaches back into SA and patches it, so that:
;    1. It checks what SKSA version is running
;    2. SA is made to read tickets from "hackit.sys" (instead of ticket.sys)
;    3. Signature verification is disabled
;
; In addition, SK is patched to disable all signature verification,
; hash checks, and console ID checks.
;
; This same idea can be used for any other patches you might want
; to apply to SA, as long as the code needed to do it fits in the
; code cave in skVerifyHash (and/or in other caves you create).
